# Assignment Name: P4HW2 – Gross Pay Calculator
# Description: This program calculates gross pay for multiple employees, including overtime and regular pay totals.

# Pseudocode:
# 1. Initialize counters and accumulators for employee count, total overtime pay, total regular pay, and total gross pay.
# 2. Loop: Ask for employee name or "Done" to terminate.
#    a. If name is not "Done":
#        i. Ask for hours worked and pay rate.
#        ii. Calculate overtime hours (if any).
#        iii. Compute overtime pay and regular pay.
#        iv. Calculate gross pay.
#        v. Display formatted pay breakdown for the employee.
#        vi. Update totals and counters.
# 3. After loop ends, display summary totals.

# Initialize totals
total_employees = 0
total_overtime_pay = 0.0
total_regular_pay = 0.0
total_gross_pay = 0.0

while True:
    name = input("Enter employee's name or 'Done' to terminate: ")
    if name.lower() == "done":
        break

    hours_worked = float(input(f"How many hours did {name} work? "))
    pay_rate = float(input(f"What is {name}'s pay rate? "))

    if hours_worked > 40:
        overtime_hours = hours_worked - 40
        regular_hours = 40
    else:
        overtime_hours = 0
        regular_hours = hours_worked

    overtime_pay = overtime_hours * pay_rate * 1.5
    regular_pay = regular_hours * pay_rate
    gross_pay = regular_pay + overtime_pay

    print(f"\nEmployee name: {name}")
    print("\nHours Worked   Pay Rate   OverTime   OverTime Pay   RegHour Pay   Gross Pay")
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print(f"{hours_worked:<14.1f}{pay_rate:<11.2f}{overtime_hours:<11.1f}{overtime_pay:<15.2f}${regular_pay:<13.2f}${gross_pay:.2f}\n")

    # Update totals
    total_employees += 1
    total_overtime_pay += overtime_pay
    total_regular_pay += regular_pay
    total_gross_pay += gross_pay

# Final summary
print(f"Total number of employees entered: {total_employees}")
print(f"Total amount paid for overtime: ${total_overtime_pay:.2f}")
print(f"Total amount paid for regular hours: ${total_regular_pay:.2f}")
print(f"Total amount paid in gross: ${total_gross_pay:.2f}")
